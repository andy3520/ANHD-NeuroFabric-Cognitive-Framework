# ANHD-NeuroFabric-Cognitive-Framework
ANHD-NeuroFabric is an open framework for building synthetic brains — distributed networks of intelligent agents that think, learn, and evolve together. Instead of one giant model, NeuroFabric organizes thousands of specialized “cells” (AI agents) that coordinate like neurons through structured messages, critics, and adaptive memory.
